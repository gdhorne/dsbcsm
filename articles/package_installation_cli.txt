[RStudio][2014] provides seamless integration with the file system to navigate and
manipulate files, the version control system to manage and synchronise local
and remote source code repositories, and the statistical computation and
software development envrionment. However, becoming comfortable with the
command line will improve our productivity as data analysis projects increase
in sophistication and work-flow automation arises.

### R Package and CRAN Mirror Management Commands

[R][2009] is a statistical programming application featuring interactive and
scripted statistical computations and graphics. The base system provides access
to pre-installed packages of functions as well as permitting the user to
install external packages available from the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network][2009] (CRAN) and other sources.

### Hands-on Practise

Preliminaries: The first time we use the install.packages() function R prompts
us to select a personal library and a CRAN mirror. Since we want to share the
same personal library between R and RStudio only respond 'y'es to the library
~/R/packages. Selecting a CRAN mirror each time is annoying so we create a
configuration file named '.Rprofile' (note the leading period) in our ${HOME}
directory.

File: [.Rprofile](../../resources/Rprofile)

	local({
		r <- getOption("repos")
		r["CRAN"] <- "http://mirror.its.dal.ca/cran/"
		options(repos = r)
	})

Substitute 'http://mirror.its.dal.ca/cran/' for a [CRAN mirror][2013] geographically
closest to you.

Exercise 1:

Install the R package 'devtools' which is required when installing other R
packages from source code in the absence of a pre-compiled version of the
package.

	$ R
	> install.packages('devtools') # quotation marks (single/double) are mandatory
	> library(devtools)            # quotation marks are not mandatory
	> quit()

Exercise 2:

Packages included with the base R system only need to be loaded into the
environment. Load the R package 'KernSmooth'.

	$ R
	> library(KernSmooth)
	> quit()

Exercise 3:

List the functions within the R package 'base'.

	$ R
	> ls(pos = "package:package_name") # substitute 'base' for package_name

Exercise 4:

Read the man(ual) page for the summary() function in R package 'base'. Type 'q'
to exit the manpage, press the SPACEBAR to scroll down one screen, or use the
cursor keys to move forward or backward.

	$ R
	> ?summary
	> quit()
