BODY:

[RStudio][2014] provides seamless integration with the file system to navigate and
manipulate files, the version control system to manage and synchronise local
and remote source code repositories, and the statistical computation and
software development envrionment. However, becoming comfortable with the
command line will improve our productivity as data analysis projects increase
in sophistication and work-flow automation arises.

### R at the Command Line

[R][2009] is a statistical programming application featuring interactive and
scripted statistical computations and graphics. The base system provides access
to pre-installed packages of functions as well as permitting the user to
install external packages available from the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network][2009] (CRAN) and other sources. At the
command line level R can be used interactively and scripted.

#### Interactive Mode

	$ R
	> print(1 + 2)
	[1] 3
	> quit()
	$ _

#### Scripted Mode

	$ echo "print(1 + 2)" > adder.r
	$ Rscript adder.r
	[1] 3
	$ _
