			<p>Welcome recruits!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="<em>blank">Data Science Specialization</a> offered by 
<a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="</em>blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> is a challenging nine-course sequence
focusing on the fundamentals of data science. Success
requires a strategy. The purpose of this blog to equip each of you with the
knowledge and skills to complete the specialisation.</p>

<p>According to Jeff Leek the keyword in "data science" is science not data.
An article in Financial Times posed the question "Big data: are we making a big 
mistake?"<sup>1</sup>, arguing for a rigorous methodology. An article
"The Data Science Methology", published on Data Science 101, argues for adoption
of the scientific method familiar to scientists in the natural sciences.
<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Data Science Methodology </p>

<ol>
<li>problem formulation (hypothesis)</li>
<li>obtain data (experiment)</li>
<li>analysis (validate or refute hypothesis)</li>
<li>data product (report)</li>
</ol>

<p>The courses in the <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="<em>blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="</em>blank">Data Science Specialization</a>
"emphasise a data science methodology rather than focusing primarily on data 
science technique. The method is not dependent upon the dataset size; it scales
from small data to big data. The data science method equates to the scientific 
method used in the natural sciences. To this end, the focus of the ten-course 
series including a capstone project is to provide the learner with:</p>

<ul>
<li>an introduction to the key ideas behind reproducible research,</li>
<li>an introduction to the tools and techniques to transform raw data into a presentable report,</li>
<li>an opportunity to gain hands-on practice, and </li>
<li>an appreciation of the mathematics &amp; statistics involved in data science.</li>
</ul>

<p>[T]he instructors have taken care throughout to demonstrate 
a responsible, scientifically-based approach to collecting, curating and 
analyzing data sources," says specialisation participant John Frederick Thiels.</p>

<h3>Core Courses</h3>

<p>The courses comprising the Data Science Specialization are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Data Scientist's Toolbox</li>
<li>R Programming</li>
<li>Getting and Cleaning Data</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li>Reproducible Research</li>
<li>Statistical Inference</li>
<li>Regression Models</li>
<li>Practical Machine Learning</li>
<li>Developing Data Products</li>
</ol>

<p>These courses taught by Brian Caffo, Jeff Leek, and Roger D. Peng enable the 
learner to get the foundational skills. While the lectures and assignments 
build these foundational skills, learners often required further explanations. 
The course forums allow learners to discuss the lecture topics and 
assignments. As a Community Teaching Assistant (CTA) it became evident a 
companion guide would be beneficial. Eventually the instructors released a
series of e-books which began as compendiums of the existing lecture notes and
now provide further coverage of the topics.</p>

<h3>Capstone Project Course</h3>

<p>If you have completed all of the core courses on Signature Track, you will be
eligible to register for the capstone project course.</p>

<h3>Structure of the Boot-Camp Survival Manual</h3>

<p>Boot-camp is structured as a set of related topics each covering one or more of
the core courses. A tutorial-style emphasising practical application enables
recruits to learn the work-flow typically practiced throughout a data analysis
project.</p>

<h2>Course Dependency and Recommended Sequence</h2>

<p>Although the courses are standalone, the knowledge is cumulative. The 
pedagogical <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/doc/JHDSS_CourseDependencies.pdf" target="_blank">course dependencies</a> are available from Johns Hopkins 
University.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Figure 1 Course dependency diagram (Jeff Jetton: created July 2014; used with permission)</em></p>

<p>You need a language or system to perform the tasks (R Programming) and data to 
analyse (Getting and Cleaning Data) to get a sense of the data (Exploratory 
Data Analysis) before building models and drawing inferences (Statistical 
Inference, Regression Models) or making predictions (Practical Machine 
Learning) from the data before presenting your conclusions and supporting 
evidence (Building Data Products, Reproducible Research).</p>

<p>The recommended mathematics background is linear algebra and introductory 
statistics (descriptive and inferential). Statistical Inference and Regression 
Models, courses in this specialisation, cover all the basic statistical 
concepts forming a solid foundation for subsequent courses in the Data Science 
Specialization. These courses along with Practical Machine Learning are the 
theoretical underpinnings, while the other six courses are
applied in nature: obtaininng data, scrubbing data, exploring data, modeling 
data, and interpreting data collectively known as the OSEMN (prounounced as 
awesome) model.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Are you up to the challenge of Johns Hopkins University's Data 
Science Specialization?</p>

Boot-Camp Survival Manual</em>" on a regular basis throughout your training.</p>
