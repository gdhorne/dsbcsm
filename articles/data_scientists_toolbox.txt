**Primary Instructor:** Jeff Leek, MS, PhD (Biostatistics)

The foundational course, [Data Scientist's Toolbox][1002], is a high-level 
overview of the [Data Science Specialization][1000].  This course lays the 
groundwork for the nine-course series plus capstone project. This course 
introduces the operating system command line, the statistical programming 
language, the statistical computing and graphing integrated development
environment, and the version/revision control system selected by the 
[Data Science Specialization Lab][1004] in the Biostatistics Department of 
[Johns Hopkins University][1001].

### Boot-Camp Requirements

To successfully complete the hands-on boot-camp exercises and course assignments
(quizzes, programming tasks, and course projects) BASH, Git, R, and RStudio must
be installed on your computer or a hosted environment. Whether these
applications are installed natively or in a virualised environment on your
computer, the tutorials presented in this boot-camp will be beneficial. See the
[Toolbox for Tools](./articles/toolbox-for_tools/index.html) tutorial.

A GitHub account is mandatory because some courses in the
[Data Science Specialization][1000] have peer-assessment activities that must
be accessible to peer evaluators (other learners in the course).

Internet access is necessary to fully participate in boot-camp as well as the
courses.

### Learning Objectives

By the time we have completed the Data Scientist's Toolbox section of boot-camp
we will be able to:

- deploy a virualised environment containing some of the tools typically used
by data analysts and data scientists
- navigate and manipulate the file system
- create and manage local and remote repositories
- create and edit documentation
- install packages for the statistical programming environment
- understand the interactive and scripted modes of the statistical programming environment
- perform these tasks at the command line and within a graphical user environment
 
A recurring theme throughout boot-camp will be a comprehensive approach to
learning fundamental skills for data science regardless of data set.

### Tools of the Data Analyst and Data Scientist

Our toolbox is stocked with an operating system command shell (bash), a
statistical computing and graphing suite (R), an integrated development
environment for the statistical computing and graphing suite (RStudio Server),
a version/revision control system (git), along with text editors
(vim and nano) and a document formatting language (markdown). We learn how to
set-up our work environment in the
[Toolbox for Tools](../toolbox_for_tools/index.html) tutorial.

### Command Line Orientation

[RStudio][2014] provides seamless integration with the file system to navigate and
manipulate files, the version control system to manage and synchronise local
and remote source code repositories, and the statistical computation and
software development envrionment. However, becoming comfortable with the
command line will improve our productivity as data analysis projects increase
in sophistication and work-flow automation arises.

We learn how to interact with our toolbox at the command line level in the
[File System Navigation and Manipulation](../file_system_navigation_and_manipulation_cli/index.html)
, [Version Control](../version_control_cli/index.html),
[R Package Installation](../package_installation_cli/index.html), and
[Statistical Programming Environment (CLI)](../statistical_programming_environment_cli/index.html)
tutorials. Afterwards we learn to accomplsih the same tasks within an unified
application by way of the
[Statistical Programming Environment (GUI)](../statistical_programming_environment_gui/index.html)
tutorial.

Writing data analysis reports which combine exectable code and the descriptive
narrative is a fundamental part of reproducible research. Initially, we focus
on preparing and processing documents containing only descriptive narrative in
the [Writing Documentation](../writing_documentation_cli/index.html) tutorial.

### Thoughts

As a data science recruit outfitted with your kit and basic skills we are
ready to move onto the next phase of basic training. The next course in the
[Data Science Specialization][1000] is [R Programming][1003]; your instructor
awaits.
The features and capabiilities of these tools extend beyond those presented.
While the graphical user interface is convenient, we highly recommend and
encourage every recruit to become comfortable with the command line as well.

Boot-camp has been easy up to this point. Read the *Data Science Boot-Camp
Survival Manual* regularly to avoid washing-out. 

Recruits, dismissed.
