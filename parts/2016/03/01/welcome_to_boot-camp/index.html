	<p>Welcome recruits!</p>

<p>I have served as a Community Teaching Assistant (CTA) and Community Mentor for 
various courses in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="<em>blank">Data Science Specialization</a> offered by
<a href="https://www.jhu.edu" target="</em>blank">Johns Hopkins University</a> between May 2014 and April 2016.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="_blank">Data Science Specialization</a> is a challenging nine-course sequence
focusing on the fundamentals of data science. Success requires a strategy.
The purpose of this blog to support each of you with the knowledge and practical 
skills to complete the specialisation. The Data Science Boot-Camp Survival
Manual has been developed independently of Johns Hopkins University and 
Coursera. It is provided as a convenience to participants in the Data Science
Specialization and as a practical introduction to data science for the general
public.</p>
