Welcome recruits!

I have served as a Community Teaching Assistant (CTA) and Community Mentor for 
various courses in the [Data Science Specialization][1000] offered by
[Johns Hopkins University][1001] between May 2014 and April 2016.

The [Data Science Specialization][1000] is a challenging nine-course sequence
focusing on the fundamentals of data science. Success requires a strategy.
The purpose of this blog to support each of you with the knowledge and practical 
skills to complete the specialisation. The Data Science Boot-Camp Survival
Manual has been developed independently of Johns Hopkins University and 
Coursera. It is provided as a convenience to participants in the Data Science
Specialization and as a practical introduction to data science for the general
public.
