BODY:

The foundational course, [Data Scientist's Toolbox][1002], is a high-level
overview of the specialisation. This course lays the groundwork for the
nine-course series plus capstone project. We will learn basic skills founded on
data science methodology rather than data science technique using a
[toolset](./articles/data_scientists_toolbox/index.html). Throughout boot-camp
and the data specialisation courses this toolbox will be our survival kit.
